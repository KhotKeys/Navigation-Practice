# Product App
================

A simple Flutter app that demonstrates product navigation.

## Overview

* `main.dart`: The entry point of the app, responsible for setting up the app's theme and routing.
* `product_list_screen.dart`: The product list screen, responsible for displaying the list of products and navigating to the details screen.
* `product_details.dart`: The product details screen, responsible for displaying more information about a selected product.
